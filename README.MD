# Computer-Mode
This project can be used to help people get things done quicker on their computer. For example, if someone has to open multiple applications for work they can set up an automated way of doing it by adding the application names to the **loadPreset.bat** file for the section titled work. If the user wants to add more presets they can do so by copying and pasting one of the other preset's if statements and changing the if statement to best match their preset.

### Usage:
```bash
Make sure the loadPreset.bat file is in your System32 folder.
To run the script type in 'loadPreset nameOfPresetYouWantToCall'
```
